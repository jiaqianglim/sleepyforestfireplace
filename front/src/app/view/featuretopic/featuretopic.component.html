          Among the existing studies, a group of studies identiÔ¨Åes useful
          networking information, using neural learning, to successfully extract
          structured information from unstructured textual networking contents.
          People use networking to post situational updates in various forms
          such as text messages, images, and videos.

      How activity boosts energy There are at least four distinct ways that
      exercise makes you feel more energetic. For starters, when you engage your
      muscles in any type of exercise, more energy-producing mitochon- dria form
      in your muscle cells. Mitochondria are the cellular powerhouses that
      convert glucose and fat into ATP, the molecule that cells use for energy.
      So while exercise burns energy, it also enables muscle cells to produce
      more energy. Second, exercise increases your body's oxygen-carrying
      capacity. Oxygen, along with glu- cose and fat, is essential to fueling
      cells, which need oxygen both to create ATP and to liberate energy stored
      as ATP. An increase in oxygen therefore gives you more stamina. Any type
      of regular exercise creates more capillaries, the tiny blood vessels that
      ferry oxygen to your cells. But aerobic exercise, by making you breathe
      the most deeply and increasing your heart rate the most, gets more oxygen
      circulating. Third, exercise affects levels of various hormones and chemi-
      cal messengers that can increase
